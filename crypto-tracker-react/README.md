Notes:

--> This submission is a project on Crypto Coin Tracker using React
--> For the router I used React Router can be foud at : 
            https://reactrouter.com/en/main
            use the command : npm install react-router-dom
--> For data, I fetched from the api : https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeListingsLatest 
--> You need to include the API key and corresponding value
--> Also you need to install and allow google chrome extenssion for passing CORS error:
        https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/CORS
