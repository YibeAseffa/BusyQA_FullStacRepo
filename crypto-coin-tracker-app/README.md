Notes:
1. This submission is a project on Crypto Coin Tracker using MERN stack 

            React for Frontend

            Node JS for Backend
            
            Express JS for web server
            
            MongoDb database


2. For the router I used React Router can be foud at : 
            https://reactrouter.com/en/main
            
            use the command : npm install react-router-dom

3.  For crypto coin data, I fetched from the api : https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeListingsLatest 
   
      For watch list I used NodeJs back end with Express JS web server and MongoDb database (Add to watchlist, Get all and delete watchlist)

4.  You need to include the API key and corresponding value for the crypro-coin api
5. Also you need to install and allow google chrome extenssion for passing CORS error:
        https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/CORS

2. Install necessery modules and dependencuies such as Node,Express,MongoDb and React and check for version compatability 
3. Open terminal/CMD
4. Go to corresponding directory and :
5. for frontend: run "npm start"
